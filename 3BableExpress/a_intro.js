Babel
=> Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScripts 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current ana older browser or environments. 
=> Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
    - Transform syntax
    - Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment
    - Source code transformations

Setup:
    @babel/core  => This is the main package to run any babel setup or configuration.
    @bable/cli => Babel comes with a built-in CLI which can be to compile files from the command line.
    @babel/preset-env => This enables us to use new and upcoming features which node.js is yet to understand. New features are always new and will probably take time to implements in NODEJS by default.

    npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
